The software engineering industry is experiencing a major shift driven by the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and the growing demand for scalable, high-quality code development practices. As development teams grow and systems become more complex, ensuring consistent code quality and adherence to best practices presents an ongoing challenge, especially in large organizations managing massive codebases across distributed teams.\\

Traditional static analysis tools and linters, while helpful, often fall short when it comes to identifying nuanced or subjective coding issues that depend on context or internal guidelines. In fast-paced development environments, engineers need intelligent, responsive tools that go beyond rule-based checks to provide deeper insights and real-time guidance, without adding friction to their daily workflows.\\

This graduation project explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence into modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to support software engineers in their day-to-day coding activities. The research investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to perform in-depth code analysis, detect complex violations, and offer clear, contextual suggestions for improvement. By embedding intelligent assistance directly within the development workflow, this work aims to enhance code quality, reduce technical debt, and support developer productivity at scale.\\

This report begins by establishing the theoretical foundation and examining the current state of AI-assisted development tools. It then presents the design and implementation of an intelligent code analysis system, followed by an evaluation of its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios. The work contributes to the broader understanding of how artificial intelligence can transform software engineering practices and improve developer experience.
