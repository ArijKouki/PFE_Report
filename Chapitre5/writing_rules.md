# Writing Rules for Chapter 5: Implementation

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on the **practical realization** of your project and should demonstrate the actual implementation of your design decisions.

## Technical Tools and Technologies Section

### Technology Justification
- **Justify your technology choices** with brief comparative analysis
- Include **state-of-the-art comparison** of available tools (even if brief)
- **Explain why** chosen technologies fit your project requirements
- **Connect technology choices** to your project constraints and objectives

### Technical Study Integration
- Technical study can be in this chapter OR done in parallel with theoretical study (Chapter 1)
- If included here, provide **convincing arguments** for your technological choices
- Even if brief, show you **evaluated alternatives** before deciding

## Application Presentation Section

### Screenshot Strategy
- **Choose a specific execution scenario** (e.g., creating a new client, processing an order)
- **Show the necessary interfaces** required for that complete scenario
- **Explain briefly** how the application behaves during the scenario
- **Be concise** - not too many images, not too many comments

### Quality Guidelines
- **Well-chosen screenshots** that actually demonstrate functionality  
- **Avoid overwhelming** readers with every possible screen
- **Scenario-driven approach** rather than random interface showcase
- **Professional presentation** - clean, clear screenshots

### Code Integration Rules
- **Avoid pasting full code** - nobody wants to see complete class contents
- **Use small code snippets** (bouts de code) only when truly necessary
- **Focus on key functionality** or innovative solutions
- If you need to show installation steps or configuration, **put in appendix**

## Implementation Details

### Key Functionality Demonstration
- **Highlight innovative or complex implementations**
- **Show how design patterns** were actually implemented
- **Demonstrate integration** between different system components
- **Focus on your specific contributions** rather than standard framework usage

### Problem-Solving Documentation
- **Document significant challenges** encountered during implementation
- **Explain solutions** you developed for complex problems
- **Show how you adapted** original design when necessary
- **Highlight learning and adaptation** process

## Technical Documentation

### Architecture Implementation
- **Show how final architecture** matches or differs from design
- **Document key implementation decisions** that weren't obvious from design
- **Explain any deviations** from original architecture and why
- **Validate that implementation** meets requirements from previous chapters

### Integration and Testing
- **Demonstrate system integration** between components
- **Show key testing approaches** used to validate functionality
- **Document deployment** considerations and setup
- **Address performance and quality** aspects

## Academic Rigor

### Implementation Analysis
- **Analyze the effectiveness** of your implementation approach
- **Compare actual results** with planned objectives
- **Evaluate technology choices** based on implementation experience
- **Identify lessons learned** during development

### Professional Documentation
- **Maintain professional tone** when discussing implementation
- **Focus on technical merit** rather than personal struggles
- **Show systematic approach** to development challenges
- **Demonstrate software engineering principles** in practice

## Content Organization

### Logical Flow
- **Start with tools/technologies** - set the technical foundation
- **Move to application demonstration** - show what was built
- **End with technical insights** - what was learned or achieved
- **Each section should build** on the previous one

### Balance and Focus
- **Not a tutorial** - don't explain basic framework usage
- **Not a code dump** - selective presentation of key elements
- **Professional demonstration** of completed work
- **Focus on your contributions** and innovations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Including every possible screenshot without clear purpose
- Pasting large blocks of code that don't add value
- Describing basic framework functionality instead of your specific work
- Making it too technical for the intended academic audience
- Forgetting to connect implementation back to requirements and design
- Including personal struggles instead of professional analysis
- Making screenshots too small or unclear to read
- Not providing enough context for code snippets

## Integration with Appendix

### What Goes in Main Chapter
- **Key implementation concepts** and decisions
- **Selected, relevant code snippets**
- **Important screenshots** demonstrating functionality
- **Analysis of implementation** effectiveness

### What Goes in Appendix  
- **Installation and configuration** procedures
- **Complete code listings** (if absolutely necessary)
- **Detailed technical specifications**
- **Additional screenshots** for completeness

## Conclusion Requirements

- **Summarize implementation achievements**
- **Highlight key technical contributions**
- **Connect implementation results** to original objectives  
- **Prepare for validation/results** chapter if applicable
- The conclusion should appear **without numbering** and not in table of contents
