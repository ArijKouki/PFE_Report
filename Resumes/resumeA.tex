This project was carried out at Google Zurich as part of a National Engineering Diploma in Software Engineering. It investigates the integration of generative artificial intelligence into the software development process by embedding a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agent within an internal Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

The agent performs in-depth code analysis to detect complex or subjective violations that traditional static analysis tools may overlook. By generating clear, human-readable explanations and actionable suggestions, it supports developers, particularly those contributing to YouTube, in maintaining high code quality and adhering to best practices. Seamlessly integrated into the development workflow through an IDE extension, the agent enhances productivity and helps reduce technical debt without disrupting the coding experience.

This work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted tooling to transform the developer experience and raises broader implications for the future of intelligent software engineering environments.\\
